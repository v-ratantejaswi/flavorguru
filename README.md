Core Functionalities 💡

NLP Functions:

Flavor Profile Extraction: This includes analyzing the ingredients to determine the flavor profile of a recipe and later match it with the flavor profile of a user according to their palate. An extension to this could be using unsupervised learning to cluster recipes into different flavor categories.

Recipe Similarity: Finding similarity among different recipes according to the ingredients, ratings and macros.

Feedback Loop: Use the user’s feedback and past choices to enhance recommendations.

User Interaction:

Dietary Preferences: Users can set their dietary preferences like vegetarian, low calorie, vegan, gluten-free, etc. so that they only get filtered recipes.

Ingredient Recipe Search: Users can input a list of ingredients and search for recipes which can be cooked using those ingredients, or most of those ingredients.

User  Feedback: Users can give feedback on recommendations or even recipes in general to refine future recommendations.
